## Building

The script `build` is a convenient short hand for building project
with default configurations.  

However, if you would like have more control over compiling this project, you
can choose to use `build.sh`.  There are also many built-in guidances available
in that script to look up.

> The default output for our executable and library file is at `out/bin/`.
